# password-generator

## Description

In order to be most secure, a password needs to long and contain a variety of characters. This application randomly generates a series of characters after the user specifies the length and which categories of characters should be included in that series. In creating this application, I found out how to generate random strings from sets of characters using Javascript.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Click "Generate Password" and answer the prompts asking how long the randomly generated password should be, whether it will include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The randomly generated series of characters will appear in the box above the  "Generate Password" button.
